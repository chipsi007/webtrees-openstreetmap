This is a [webtrees](http://webtrees.net) plugin for displaying location data on openstreetmap tiles, and displayed via leaflet.

## Requirements
This module requires webtrees 1.5+.

For now, this module relies on the Google Maps module. In the future, the plan is to remove that requirement.

## Installation
### via zip/tarball
Download the plugin, based on your webtrees version, and unpack it into `webtrees/modules/openstreetmap`

| Webtrees version | zip | tarball |

Feel free to open a PR with any changes you'd like to make to this plugin. I don't have a whole lot of time to devote to this, but I will definitely review (and probably merge) any PRs in a timely manner.
